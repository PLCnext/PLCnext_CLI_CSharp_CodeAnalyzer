# Iec021 - Methods can only have one Output parameter at the first position

**Severity:** ![Error](../images/Error.png) Error

IEC methods/functions are only allowed to have one parameter with the `[Output]` attribute. It must be the first parameter.
IEC methods/functions that can have parameters are methods that either:

* have the attribute `[User]`
* have the attribute `[Execution]`, are called `__Process` and are in a class with the attribute `[Function]`
* have the attribute `[Function]` and are in a class with the attribute `[FunctionContainer]`

## Solution

Remove the parameters or their `[Output]` attributes from the method.
