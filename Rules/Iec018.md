# Iec018 - Structure fields should be pointers

![Suggestion](images/Suggestion.png) Suggestion

Checks fields with the attributes `[Output]`, ` [Input]`, `[InOut]`, `[InputPort]` or `[OutputPort]` when the field type is a struct that was declared with `[Structure]` or `[Array]` attribute.
If the `struct` type is large, it should be a pointer type with the `[InOut]` attribute to improve the performance.

The field is reported if:
- it is not a pointer type
- or it does not have the `[InOut]` attribute

## Solution

Evaluate whether the structure type is large and the performance advantage is enough to use `unsafe` code.

You can also use the provided automatic Code Fix to change the type to pointer and change the attribute to `[InOut]`. ( Press Alt + Enter on the Error line to find the Code Fix in the context menu) 

Change the type to be a pointer and change the attribute to `[InOut]`. Don't forget to refactor the references.
