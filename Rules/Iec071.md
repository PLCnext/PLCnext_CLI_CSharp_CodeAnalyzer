# Iec071 - Elements need unique names

**Severity:** ![Error](images/Error.png) Error

Elements should have unique names.
Fields of the same Program Organization Unit (classes marked with `[Function]`, `[FunctionBlock]`, `FunctionContainer` or `[Program]`) or user struct (structs marked with `[Structure]`) should differ in more than casing to avoid Problems in the PLCnextEngineer.
Parameters of the same exported method should differ in more than casing to avoid Problems in the PLCnextEngineer.

## Solution

Rename parameters or fields until their names are unique by more than casing.
