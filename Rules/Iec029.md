# Iec029 - Init/ctor has to be called in Initialization for FunctionBlock fields that provide Init/ctor

**Severity:** ![Error](../images/Error.png) Error

For all fields with the attribute `[Output]`, ` [Input]` or `[Local]` of `[FunctionBlock]`s (classes attributed with `[FunctionBlock]`) 
that provide an `Init()` or `ctor()` method, the method has to be called in the `__Init()` method of the `[FunctionBlock]`.
The method looks like this:

```c#
 [Initialization] 
 public void __Init() {}
```

Mostly IEC Strings provide a `ctor()` method and user types often provide an `Init()` method.

## Solution

You can also use the provided automatic Code Fix to create all missing calls and the `__Init()` method itself. ( Press Alt + Enter on the Error line to find the Code Fix in the context menu) 

Provide the `__Init()` method and call the  `Init()`/`ctor()` methods of all fields.
