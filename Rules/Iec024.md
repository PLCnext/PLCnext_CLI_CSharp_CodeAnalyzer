# Iec024 - Silently reports any struct declaration to provide templates for User Array, Structure and String

**Severity:** Silent

This diagnostic is no mistake and is never visible in any error list (because the severity is silent).

It provides codefixes in the context menu on every struct declaration.
The codefixes replace the struct declaration with the chosen template, only the name remains.

For more information on the templates view the GitHub samples on [Structures](https://github.com/PLCnext/CSharpExamples/blob/master/PLCnext_CSharpExamples/03_UserStruct/UserStruct.md), [Arrays](https://github.com/PLCnext/CSharpExamples/blob/master/PLCnext_CSharpExamples/04_UserArray/UserArray.md) and [Strings](https://github.com/PLCnext/CSharpExamples/blob/master/PLCnext_CSharpExamples/05_IECString/IECString.md).

Use one of the three provided Codefixes by pressing Alt + Enter on any struct declaration. The codefix adds the named template.
