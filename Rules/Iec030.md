# Iec030 - IEC Structs have to provide an Init Method calling field's Init/ctor method when any fields have it

**Severity:** ![Error](../images/Error.png) Error

For all fields that provide an `Init()` or `ctor()` method of `struct`s attributed with `[Structure]`, the method has to be called in the `Init()` method of the Structure.
The method looks like this:

```c#
 public void Init() {}
```

Mostly IEC Strings provide a `ctor()` method and user types often provide an `Init()` method.

## Solution

You can also use the provided automatic Code Fix to create all missing calls and the `Init()` method itself. ( Press Alt + Enter on the Error line to find the Code Fix in the context menu) 

Provide the `Init()` method and call the `Init()`/`ctor()` methods of all fields.
