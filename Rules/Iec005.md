# Iec005 - Return Type has to be IEC compatible

**Severity:** ![Error](../images/Error.png) Error

IEC methods/functions have to return types that are compatible with IEC.
IEC methods/functions that can have return values are methods that either:
* have the attribute `[User]`
* have the attribute `[Execution]`, are called `__Process` and are in a class with the attribute `[Function]`
* have the attribute `[Function]` and are in a class with the attribute `[FunctionContainer]`

**Explicitly allowed types are**

CSharp basic types:

* `bool`
* `sbyte`
* `short`
* `int`
* `long`
* `byte`
* `ushort`
* `uint`
* `ulong`
* `float`
* `double`

.Net basic types:

* `Boolean`
* `SByte`
* `Int16`
* `Int32`
* `Int64`
* `Byte`
* `UInt16`
* `UInt32`
* `UInt64`
* `Single`
* `Double`

IEC types:

* `enums` attributed with `[Enumeration]`



**Eplicitly forbidden:**

* all `Any`* types [Iec022](Rules/Iec022.md)
* Structures `[Structure]` or Arrays `[Array]` [Iec022](Rules/Iec022.md)
* `IecStringEx`, `IecString80`, `IecWString`, `IecWString80` TODO-LINKING

## Solution

Change the return type to one of the explicitly allowed types.
