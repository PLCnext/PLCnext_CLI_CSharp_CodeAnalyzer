# Iec004 - Parameters of user types or Any have to use ref

**Severity:** ![Warning](../images/Warning.png) Warning

IEC method/function parameters that have the parameter type `Any` or a user `struct` (Structs with the attributes `[Structure]`, `[String]` or `[Array]`) have to use the `ref` keyword.

* have the attribute `[User]`
* have the attribute `[Execution]`, are called `__Process` and are in a class with the attribute `[Function]`
* have the attribute `[Function]` and are in a class with the attribute `[FunctionContainer]`
