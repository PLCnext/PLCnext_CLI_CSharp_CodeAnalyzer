# Iec089 - Also implement non-generic IComparer when implementing generic IComparer
**Severity:** ![Error](../images/Error.png) Error

To use implementations of generic `IComparer<T>` with methods of `List<T>` you have to implement non-generic `IComparer` too. Otherwise the eCLR does not support the usage.

## Solution

You can also use the provided automatic Code Fix to add the non-generic `IComparer` to the base list. ( Press Alt + Enter on the Error line to find the Code Fix in the context menu) 

Implement the non-generic `IComparer`.
